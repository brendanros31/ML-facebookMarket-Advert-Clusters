# Facebook Marketplace Listing Analysis â€“ Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­

This project analyzes listing data from **Facebook Marketplace in Thailand** to uncover how users engage with posts. 

The goal is to identify the most **impactful listing strategies** by understanding- what makes listings more effective?.

We use **reactions, comments, shares**, and **engagement patterns** from the Listings, and apply unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to achive the desired outcome.

---

## Project Overview

We explore a dataset of product listings and their engagement metrics to answer:

- What kinds of posts get more reactions, shares, and comments?
- Are there identifiable **clusters** of listing types based on engagement?
- Can we predict listing effectiveness using classification models?
- What features influence listing performance the most?

## Methods & Techniques Used

### ðŸ§¼ Data Preprocessing
- Handled outliers in the data for better model performance
- Feature engineering (e.g. total positive/negative engagement score)
- Standardization of numeric features

### ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized distribution of shares, reactions, comments
- Category-wise engagement insights

### ðŸ“ˆ Clustering with K-Means
- Grouped listings based on engagement features
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal clusters
- Visualized clusters using **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)

### ðŸ¤– Classification Models
- Trained models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**

### ðŸ“Š Dimensionality Reduction
- Used **PCA** for visualization and performance tuning
- Explored feature importance
